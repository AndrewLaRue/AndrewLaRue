## Hello, I'm Andrew.

I'm currently a student at Boise Codeworks in the great state of Idaho.  I've dedicated my professional life thus far to being a Tradesman, specifically Plumbing.  That choice allowed me to start and establish my family early and, while I enjoyed helping people, I was never really passionate about it.  I've reached a point in my life where I can afford to take a risk and pursue something that really interests me.

The training I've received has certainly been challenging at times but I can honestly say I've enjoyed every minute of it.  I've always loved to learn new things and the ability to put that passion towards a common goal has been amazing.

I'm currently comfortable with HTML and CSS(+bootstrap) with a growing understanding of JavaScript, Vue, and the MVC+S pattern.  As time goes on, I'll be updating this with additional proficiencies.
